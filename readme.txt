MONTAGE OS Open Source Operating System

Montage Beta release 0.0003
contains X-GUI, the windowing system, and Paint.
This disk contains the OS and the full Tackle IDE (QBASIC, BASIC)
Source code. This project was started on march 1st and is nowhere 
near complete. The Development team consists of Mark Bassett, Scott
Rallya, and Alex Thompson. If you did not download this copy from
http://montage.7p.com or get it in an email from
sk8er23241@aol.com then it is not official and you should get the
official copy at http://montage.7p.com 

Source code is in srccode.zip , and the programming language is in the
file tackle.zip. Have fun with it and do not rip us off.

**NOTE: Do not use the CLI because the fool that wrote it didn't implement
 it correctly.

The only authorized coders to even touch the source code is A.) anyone
in my 4th period web design class and B.) Fellow Molten Software operators.

Don't expect this to be great, because its not.

To run execute: xgui
