Made new mouse pointer graphic, added a M Application called
Color Settings, so now people can change there desktop
colors and shadow colors. Fixed some magor bugs that I seemed
to only find, still need to fix the mouse pointer bug, it
flickers on older computers like 286 and 386 systems. Works
good on my 486 75.
